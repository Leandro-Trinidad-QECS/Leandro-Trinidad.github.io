                    American singer and songwriter Beyoncé has released six studio albums, four live albums, three compilation albums, five EPs, one soundtrack album, one mixtape, two karaoke albums, and 66 singles (including 10 as a featured artist, eight promotional singles
                    and five charity singles). She has sold 100 million records as a solo artist, Destiny's Childand a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Recording Industry Association
                    of America (RIAA) recognized her as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s decade. As of June 2016, in the United States, Beyoncé has sold 17.2 million albums as a solo artist, and a further 17 million albums as part of Destiny's Child.<br><br>                    Beyoncé's career began as lead vocalist of Destiny's Child. She released her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), during the hiatus of Destiny's Child. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and produced the singles
                    "Crazy in Love", "Baby Boy", "Me, Myself and I", "Naughty Girl" and "The Closer I Get to You". With "Crazy in Love" and Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé became the first female artist—and the fifth artist ever—to top both the singles and
                    albums charts simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2003, "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for eight and nine weeks, respectively. Dangerously in Love has sold
                    11 million copies worldwide.<br><br> After the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2005, Beyoncé released "Check on It" featuring Slim Thug for The Pink Panther soundtrack. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks,
                    and was later included on her second studio album, B'Day (2006), which produced six singles, including top-ten hits "Déjà Vu", "Irreplaceable" and "Beautiful Liar". "Ring the Alarm" became Beyoncé's highest debut on the US Billboard
                    Hot 100 chart, entering at number twelve in 2006, whereas "Irreplaceable" remained at the top of the same chart for ten consecutive weeks in 2006–07, becoming her longest-running single at the pole position of the chart.
                    <br><br> Beyoncé's third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), was a double CD set, intended to reflect the two facets of her personality. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and included the singles "If I Were a Boy",
                    "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for four weeks, "Halo" and "Sweet Dreams". I Am... Sasha Fierce sold 3.12 million copies in the United States, and the album has sold eight million copies
                    worldwide as of 2015. Beyoncé's fourth studio album, 4, was released in June 2011 and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart. The album's first two singles, "Run the World (Girls)" and "Best Thing I Never Had", both reached the top
                    ten in several charts worldwide, whilst the fourth single "Love on Top" topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks, while peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest peak from the album.<br><br>                    Beyoncé's self-titled fifth album, Beyoncé, was unexpectedly released to the iTunes Store in December 2013 and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming her fifth consecutive number one album in the United States. After just
                    three days of sales, Beyoncé became the fastest-selling album ever on iTunes, both in the US and worldwide. The album's highest charting single was "Drunk in Love", which reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100.<br><br> Beyoncé's
                    sixth studio album Lemonade was released on April 23, 2016 after an hour-long accompanying video that premiered on HBO. With Lemonade, Beyoncé became the first act in history to have six consecutive number one albums in the US. All
                    twelve tracks from Lemonade charted within the Hot 100 in the US, breaking a record previously held by Taylor Swift for having the most songs chart consecutively with 11 for a female artist. The album's lead single "Formation" debuted
                    at number 10 on the Hot 100, becoming Beyoncé's first top ten single in the US since 2013's "Drunk in Love", and her first solo top ten single in the US since 2009's "Sweet Dreams".<br><br></p>
