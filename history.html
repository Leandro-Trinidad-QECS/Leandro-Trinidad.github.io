                    <h1>Beyoncé</h1>

                    <p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer
                        of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003),
                        which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy". Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released
                        her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits "Déjà Vu", "Irreplaceable", and "Beautiful Liar". Beyoncé also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006) and starring roles in
                        The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha
                        Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album
                        4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul.Her critically acclaimed fifth album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration
                        of darker themes. With the release of Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé became the first artist to have their first six studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over
                        100 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child,making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. he has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history.
                        She is the most awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, with 24 wins.The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s (decade).In 2009, Billboard named her
                        the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade,the Top Female Artist of the 2000s (decade) and handed their Millennium Award in 2011.Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014, and in 2016 she
                        occupied the sixth place for Person of the Year.Forbes also listed her as the most powerful female in entertainment of 2015.

                    <h1>Early life</h1>
                    <p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine "Tina" Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.Beyoncé's
                        younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had No. 1 albums.Mathew is African American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (African,
                        Native American, and French).Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. Beyoncé attended St. Mary's Montessori School in Houston, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was
                        discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven,
                        singing John Lennon's "Imagine" to beat 15/16-year-olds.In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir.She also attended the High
                        School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School.Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years. When Beyoncé was eight, she and childhood friend
                        Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.After
                        seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the
                        song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group.The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.Mathew cut the
                        original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records
                        briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In
                        1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.</p>

                    <h1>Personal life</h1>

                    <p>Beyoncé started a relationship with Shawn "Jay Z" Carter after their collaboration on "'03 Bonnie & Clyde",which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).Beyoncé appeared as Jay Z's girlfriend in the
                        music video for the song, fuelling speculation about their relationship.On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z married without publicity.As of April 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.They are known
                        for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Beyoncé suffered a miscarriage in 2010 or 2011, describing it as "the saddest thing" she had ever endured.She returned to the studio
                        and wrote music in order to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video
                        Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed "Love on Top" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in
                        12.4 million viewers;the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for "most tweets per second recorded for a single event" on Twitter,receiving 8,868 tweets per second and "Beyonce pregnant" was the most Googled term the
                        week of August 29, 2011. On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[280] Beyoncé performed "America the Beautiful" at the 2009 presidential inauguration, as well
                        as "At Last" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.They held a fundraiser at Jay Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $4 million.In the 2012 Presidential
                        election, Beyoncé voted for Obama.She performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration.The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee
                        Hillary Clinton. In 2013, Beyoncé stated in an interview with Vogue that she considered herself to be "a modern-day feminist".She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling "We should all be feminists",
                        a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song "Flawless", released later that year.She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses television and social
                        media to encourage leadership in girls.Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned. Beyoncé publicly endorsed same
                        sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.The singer has also condemned police brutality against black Americans. Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the
                        acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin.The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their murdered sons in the video
                        for "Freedom".In a 2016 interview with Elle, she responded to the controversy surrounding her song "Formation" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, "I am against police brutality and injustice. Those
                        are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me"</p>
